This repo captures hard-won settings and tool installations that I have
accumulated over time. Using the included modular setup script, starting from
a fresh installation of Ubuntu Linux or MacOS I can have everything I'm used to
-- programs and all -- in a few minutes.

It doubles as a "batteries included" set of configuration files that can be used
by others just starting out. It includes:

- bash config
- tmux config
- vim/neovim config
- various tool installation commands

If you don't want "batteries included", you can select only what is most useful
to you because:

- the `setup.sh` script is modular
- the [documentation]( https://daler.github.io/dotfiles/) explains everything
- the config files themselves are documented
